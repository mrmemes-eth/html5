# HTML5 Experiments

A grab bag of experiments with some of the new HTML5 APIs (or at least it will
be&hellip; maybe&hellip; unless I get lazy).

### Note

These experiments have thus far only been tested in [Google
Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

Some experiments may need to be served via HTTP in order to function (such as
the Web SQL experiment). I'm using [adsf](http://stoneship.org/software/adsf/)
to serve up the project directory locally. It might work for you too.
